one of which is what we call a visible input layer and the other is called a hidden layer. The hidden layer is used to learn features from the information fed through the input layer. For our model, the input is going to contain X neurons, where X is the amount of movies in our dataset. Each of these neurons will possess a normalized rating value varying from 0 to 1 -- 0 meaning that a user has not watched that movie and the closer the value is to 1, the more the user likes the movie that neuron's representing. These normalized values, of course, will be extracted and normalized from the ratings dataset.\n","\n","After passing in the input, we train the RBM on it and have the hidden layer learn its features.
