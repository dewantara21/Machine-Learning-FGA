Sometimes it is useful to put the eigenvalues in ascending order. But when we do, we might also want to rearrange the eigenvectors so they still go with the eigenvalues. We do this using an indirect sort, provided by the numpy argsort() function. An indirect sort generates a list of indices that wouuld put the values in order, but it doesn't actually do the sort. So, for example if we want to sort the numbers w = [4.2, 2.1, 5.7] in ascending order, taking terms with indices [1, 0, 2], that is [w[1], w[0], w[2]], puts them in order. The indirect sort gives us just the list of indices.
